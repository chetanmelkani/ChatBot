# ChatBot
This is the repository that contains the feature specification of my final year project. It was based on NLP(Natural Language Processing), it uses a heuristical pattern matching approach to understand users input and then respond to those queries by looking at its database and trying to have a small talk with the user.

The ultimate aim was to have a self-sufficient system that could act as a medium of live help for user queries.

It was written in Java, It uses XML schema similar to AIML to understand human language rules. This XML forms as the database for communicating with the user. It also contains an admin module that add the database to the existing after seeing which all communications the bot failed to answer effectively, as they are stored in a flat file structure.
