# ChatBot
This is the repository that contains the feature specification of my final year project. It was based on NLP(Natural Language Processing) it uses a heuristical pattern matching approach to understand users input and then respod to those queries by looking at its database and trying to have a small talk with the user.

The ultimate aim was to have a self sufficient system that could act as a medium of live help for user queries.
